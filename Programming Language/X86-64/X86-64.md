X86-64 Assembly Language Note Book. There are some important features in X86-64 assembly language and In X86 Machine Organization.

Based ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) 8086, x86, i386, x64, and this note contain two types of assembly language style ! Intel NASM (Microsoft MASM) and GNU AT&T Assembly


Assembler : nasm, as

> This notes also include some differences between these two styles !


### Special Features

#### AT&T

##### Basic Operation
In AT&T Style, the following content means that you copy the value from immediate value 0x7c00 to `AX` register !

From left operand to the right operand !
```as
MOV $0x7c00, %AX
```

When you notice that before the register you must add `%` symbol, and before the immediate number you must add `$` symbol to represent the operand !


##### Data Type
Operand Suffix for Data Type : 

| suffix | size | operand |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| b      | 1    | movb    |
| w      | 2    | movw    |
| l      | 4    | movd    |
| q      | 8    | movq    |

#### nasm
##### Basic Operation
In nasm, the coding this line means that you move 0x7c00 to `AX` register

From right operand to left operand !
```as
MOV AX, 0x7c00
```


### Register

#### General Purpose Register
There are some general purpose registers and their utilities !
1. rax
2. rbx
3. rcx
4. rdx
5. rsi
6. rdi
7. rbp
	- This register usually used as a pointer, pointer at the bottom of the stack.
8. rsp
	- This register is similar with `rbp`, also used as a pointer, point at the top of the stack .


#### Flag Register

In addition to the integer registers, the CPU maintains a set of single-bit condition code registers describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation. These registers can then be tested to perform conditional branches. These condition codes are the most useful:

Arithmetic Related Flags: 
- cf: Carry flag. The most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. Used to detect overflow for unsigned operations.

- zf: Zero flag. The most recent operation yielded zero.

- sf: Sign flag. The most recent operation yielded a negative value.

- of: Overflow flag. The most recent operation caused a two's-complement overflowâ€”either negative or positive.


### Data Type



### Access Address

This Part Describe Some General Rules for Memory Access or Address Search .

$R[\ ]$ : means the value of Register
$M[\ ]$: means the value of Memory

$Imm$ : Immediate Operand Number 
$r_b$ : Base address Register
$r_i$ : Variable address Register
$S$ : Factor, Must be 1, 2, 4 or 8

$$ 
ValidAddress = Imm + R[r_b] + R[r_i] \times S
$$
For Example The code `8(%rax, %rdx, 4)` equals to `8 + %rax + %rdx * 4`


### Stack

There are several instructions to manipulate Stack in Computer 
Stack is a special Structure, that starts at High Address and ends at low address.

So `bp` points at the bottom of the stack and `sp` points at the top of the stack

- push : `pushq %rax` similar to 
	`subq $8, %rsp`
	`movq %rax, (%rsp)`

- pop : `popq %rax` similar to
	 `movq (%rsp), %rax`
	 `addq $8, %rsp`


### Arithmetic Operation

There are some arithmetic operation in X86 assembly 

----------------

#### Basic Arithmetic Operation

| Instruction | C format     | note                         |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| lea         | `8 + x + 3y` | load effective address       |
| inc         | `++x`        |                              |
| dec         | `--x`        |                              |
| neg         | `-x`         |                              |
| not         | `~x`         |                              |
| add         | `x += n`     |                              |
| sub         | `x -= n`     |                              |
| imul        | `x *= n`     | the result will be truncated |
| xor         | `x ^= n`     |                              |
| or          | `x \= n`     |                              |
| and         | `x &= n`     |                              |
| sal         | `x <<= n`    |                              |
| shl         | `x <<= n`    |                              |
| sar         | `x >>= n`    | arithmetic shrift            |
| shr         | `x >>= n`    | logic shrift                 |

#### Special Arithmetic Operation

| Instruction | Note                    | argument                                                  | result                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| imul S      | signed multiplication   | `%rax`: fist operand `S`: second operand                  | `%rdx`: high bits `%rax`: low bits  |
| mul  S      | unsigned multiplication | `%rax`: fist operand `S`: second operand                  | `%rdx`: high bits `%rax`: low bits  |
| idiv  S     | signed division         | dividend : `%rdx`high bits `%rax` low bits divisor: `S`   | quotient : `%rax` remainder: `%rdx` |
| div  S      | unsigned division       | dividend : `%rdx`high bits  `%rax` low bits  divisor: `S` | quotient : `%rax` remainder: `%rdx` |

> Note : `imul` can have different operation on different argument the first type is that there is only one argument that is a formal standard, the second one is have two argument which is a new type of multiplication and the result will truncated !

Operation `cqto` it will expand signed bit in `%rax` to `%rdx` , fill with `0x00` or `0xff` this is an auxiliary function for division operation ! This func is mainly used for signed division.


### Condition Operation

When we want out application have different choices and different branches will need condition judgement and control operation

There are two Basic Low-level Rules to implement conditional judgement.
1. compare or test the value or data
2. change the way of the progress

#### Change Flag Register

We can use instruction `CMP` and `TEST` to set the special bits of flag register !

> Note : This instruction just set flags, they do not change the value of the operands !

| Instruction                                       | Based        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| CMP     $S_1,\ S_2$   `cmpb` `cmpw` `cmpl` `cmpq` | $S_2 - S_1$  |
| TEST    $S_1,\ S_2$   `testb testw testl testq`   | $S1\ \&\ S2$ |

In the AT&T style, the meaning of CMP is different to NASM ! Which is reverse to formal Standard ! 


#### Jump Instruction

There are some instructions related to Jump !

| instructions   | synonym | description   |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| jmp   Label    |         | direct jump   |
| jmp   *Operand |         | indirect jump |
| je             | jz      | =             |
| jne            | jnz     | !=            |
| js             |         | negative      |
| jns            |         | non-negative  |
| jg             | jnle    | signed >      |
| jge            | jnl     | signed >=     |
| jl             | jnge    | signed <      |
| jle            | jng     | signed <=     |
| ja             | jnbe    | unsigned >    |
| jae            | jnb     | unsigned >=   |
| jb             | jnae    | unsigned <    |
| jbe            | jna     | unsigned <=   |
