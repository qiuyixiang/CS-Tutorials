### Machine Code

This Table is an explanation of how to transfer x86 Assembly code to binary machine code which can run in x86, i386, 8086, x86-64 machine architecture

**Instruction Prefixes:** appears at the beginning of an instruction. Prefixes are optional. A programmer can choose to use a prefix or not.  

**Opcode:**  is a unique number that identifies an instruction. Each opcode is given an mnemonic name that is human readable, e.g. one of the opcodes for instruction add is 04. When a CPU sees the number 04 in its instruction cache, it sees instruction add and execute accordingly. Opcode can be 1,2 or 3 bytes long and includes an additional 3-bit field in the ModR/M byte when needed

**ModR/M:** specifies operands of an instruction. Operand can either be a register, a memory location or an immediate value. This component of an instruction consists of 3 smaller parts
- mod field, or modifier field, is combined with r/m field for a total of 5 bits of information to encode 32 possible values: 8 registers and 24 addressing modes.
- reg/opcode field encodes either a register operand, or extends the Opcode field with 3 more bits.
- r/m field encodes either a register operand or can be combined with mod field to encode an addressing mode
